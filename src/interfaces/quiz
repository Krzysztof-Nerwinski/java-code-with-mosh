1. To create a decoupled code, remove ties between classes and allow for easier testing and
extending or replacing parts of code
2. tightly coupled code is a code that when changed in one place requires changes or recompilation
in completely business unrelated other parts of code
3. tightly coupled as TaxReport method creates new instance of other class directly
4. dependency injection is how we insert other instances of classes into class
5. constructor injection, method injection, setter injection
6. interface segregation principle
7. it creates coupled code and contradicts interfaces purpose as contracts not implementation
8. both creates a boilerplate to implement in newly created classes. can define a set of rules
and methods
Interfaces should only describe behaviour, abstract classes can implement some parts of behaviour
9. No, only if it makes sense, meaning only when class is coupled
